# **SLOW NUCES**
#### Our final OOP project in which we have tried developing a replica of FAST-NUCES using SFML in C++, which we named SLOW-NUCES =]

### Introducing Character and SLOW-NUCES
We have a main character, let's call it Junaid. 
Whenever the game window renders Junaid finds himself in the mulitpurpose building's ground alone with you. On the ground, we have a futsal court, a badminton court (which are not functional in this version), and ofcourse, the multipurpose building itself.

### **Exploring the Multipurpose Building**
Inside the multipurpose building,  things get interesting! Junaid can engage in various activities. He can play table tennis with his friend, who is an artificially intelligent bot. The building also houses a cafeteria where Junaid can buy snacks, a library where he can borrow books, and an auditorium (which is not functional in the current version).

 To fight boredom, Junaid goes to the table tennis place, where he plays with his friend (a bot).

After playing table tennis, Junaid goes to explore the library. He can borrow books from the library counter.

After exploring table tennis and the library, Junaid heads upstairs to the cafeteria to grab some snacks or other food items. He pays the bill after picking up the snacks and then leaves the cafe.

Junaid then finds himself back inside the multipurpose building, and now there is nothing to explore except the auditorium, which is not functional, so he exits the building. Junaid realizes that he has exams next week and has missed all of his scheduled classes just to give you a tour of his university, SLOW-NUCES.

##### Junaid also claims that he can get motivation to study for his exams if someone stars the repository. Give it a star so that Junaid can find the motivation needed to prepare for his exams.
